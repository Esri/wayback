# World Imagery Wayback App
This app provides a dynamic browsing experience where previous World Imagery versions are presented within the map, along a timeline, and as a list. Versions that resulted in local changes are dynamically presented to the user based on location and scale. Preview changes by hovering and/or selecting individual layers. When ready, one or more Wayback layers can be added to an export queue and pushed to a new ArcGIS Online web map.

## Getting Started

```sh
https://github.com/Esri/wayback.git
```

From the project's root directory, install the required packages (dependencies):

```sh
npm install
```

## Running the app 
Now you can start the webpack dev server to test the app on your local machine:

```sh
# it will start a server instance and begin listening for connections from localhost on port 8080
npm run start
```

## Deployment
To build/deploye the app, you can simply run:

```sh
# it will place all files needed for deployment into the /build directory 
npm run build
```
