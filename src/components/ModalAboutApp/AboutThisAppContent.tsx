                snapshot of the entire World Imagery map, as it existed on the
                date it was published. Wayback currently provides access to all
                published versions of World Imagery, dating back to February 20,
                2014. There is an ArcGIS Online item for every version which can

            <h5 className="text-xl mb-3">WHY</h5>
            <p className="mb-6">
                As World Imagery is updated with more current imagery, new
                versions of the map are published. When and where updates occur,
                the previous imagery is replaced and is no longer visible. For
                many use cases, the new imagery is more desirable and typically
                preferred. Other times, however, the previous imagery may
                support use cases that the new imagery does not. In these cases,
                a user may need to access a previous version of World Imagery.
            </p>

            <h5 className="text-xl mb-2">HOW</h5>
            <p className="mb-6">
                Available versions of the World Imagery map are presented within
                a timeline and as layers in a list. Versions that resulted in
                local changes are highlighted in bold white, and the layer
                currently selected is highlighted in blue. Point and click on
                the map for additional imagery details within the selected
                layer. One or more layers can be added to a queue and pushed to
                a new ArcGIS Online web map.
