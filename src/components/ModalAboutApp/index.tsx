                    <h5 className="">WHY</h5>
                    <p>
                        As World Imagery is updated with more current imagery,
                        new versions of the map are published. When and where
                        updates occur, the previous imagery is replaced and is
                        no longer visible. For many use cases, the new imagery
                        is more desirable and typically preferred. Other times,
                        however, the previous imagery may support use cases that
                        the new imagery does not. In these cases, a user may
                        need to access a previous version of World Imagery.
                    </p>

                    <h5 className="">HOW</h5>
                    <p>
                        Available versions of the World Imagery map are
                        presented within a timeline and as layers in a list.
                        Versions that resulted in local changes are highlighted
                        in bold white, and the layer currently selected is
                        highlighted in blue. Point and click on the map for
                        additional imagery details within the selected layer.
                        One or more layers can be added to a queue and pushed to
                        a new ArcGIS Online web map.
